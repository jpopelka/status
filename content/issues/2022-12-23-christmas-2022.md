All the team is on vacation.
Give us some time to get refreshed and be better prepared to work hard on Packit's new features and bugs.

The Packit staging instance (https://dashboard.stg.packit.dev/) will not run during this week.
It will be back on the 2nd of January.

Have a wonderful year 2023 everyone! We're back, staging instance is up and serving.
